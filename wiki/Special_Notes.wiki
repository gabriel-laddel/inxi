#summary Special programming notes, resources, and information.
=Resources we have found useful for developing inxi=
==Gawk and Bash==
 * gawk arrays: http://www.math.utah.edu/docs/info/gawk_12.html
 * Bash string padding with sed: http://ideatrash.net/2011/01/bash-string-padding-with-sed.html 
   This is the important part of the code:
   {{{
Left justify with string length of 80
sed -e :a -e 's/^.\{1,80\}$/& /;ta'
Right justify with string length of 80
sed -e :a -e 's/^.\{1,80\}$/ &/;ta'
Center with string length of 80.
sed -e :a -e 's/^.\{1,80\}$/ & /;ta'
}}}
 * Bash Regular Expressions: http://analyser.oli.tudelft.nl/regex/index.html.en
   More Bash regex: http://www.faqs.org/docs/abs/HTML/regexp.html
 * Bash special characters and variables: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/special-chars.html
 * Bash parameter substitution: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/parameter-substitution.html
==Information About Changing Packages for Recommends/Dependencies==
Things change, and inxi has to adjust and change with them or it won't work.

 * Moving from the venerable net-tools, parent of ifconfig, to iproute/iproute2, parent of ip, which replaces ifconfig as far as inxi is concerned:
